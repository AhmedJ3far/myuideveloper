Project description
The project is my own portfolio website. I uploaded all my previous works to it. I was responsible for implementing the project from the beginning of the idea to the design stage, then to the development stage, and then to the final product. It took me about three weeks to finish the project, and the steps were as follows:

first, I watched a lot of similar projects to get inspiration then.

I started working on wireframes for the website using Adobe XD.

Third, I made colors and some icons to add aesthetic shape to the design.

Fourth, after the design process, I started the programming process using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages.

And make it responsive to most screens as possible.
